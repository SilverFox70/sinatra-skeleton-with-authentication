# User Registration and Authentication

## Summary
This is my version of a sinatra skeleton with user authentication and registration.  It only has the most bare bones functionality right now, but is adaptable and extensible for various projects.

### TO DO list:

* Add dual authentication check in user.rb file to verify both email and correct password OR provide a password retrieval mechanism

* Implement partials where possible (such as with displaying error messages)

* Change the routing when a user successfully logs in or provide a partial to let the user know that authentication succeeded.
